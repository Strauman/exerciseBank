New awesome features in this simple exercise management system.

New features
- You can now (finally) tag problems and selectively show problems based on their tags.
- Point system implemented!
- You can hide specific exercises by doing \nextproblem{hide} above them
- You can now set default \makeset keys, and override them in \buildset and \buildsets
- \DeclareExerciseCommand now takes args

Bug fixes:
- Fixed problems related to \ShowNumbers not showing correctly.
- Fixed \exec so that it now can take paragraphs (made it \long)
- Fixed bug where vertical space would remain when intro environment hidden

A special mention to the github users @tristelune1 and @thorstengrothe
for doing a lot of the testing for this version! Thank you!
