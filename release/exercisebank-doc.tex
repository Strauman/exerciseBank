\section{Reference}
\subsection{Environments}
\begin{docEnvironment}{problem}{}
Inside the \dac{keyRef}\{exercise directory\}, you keep your exercises. Inside the exercise file you'd use a problem environment to write your partproblems. It might be a little confusing that you're using \dac{begin}\{problem\} instead of \dac{begin}\{partproblem\} when you're writing a partproblem, but it's less typing.
\end{docEnvironment}
\begin{docEnvironment}{solution}{}
 Things inside here is only visible if \refCom{DisplaySolutions} are given before \dac{begin}\{document\}
 \begin{marker}\dac{end}\{solution\} has to be on it's own line without any leading spaces!\end{marker}
\end{docEnvironment}
\begin{docCommand}{DisplaySolutions}{}
Turns on the solutions, so they are shown.
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docEnvironment}{intro}{}
Sometimes you'd want to introcude your exercises and tell a little bit about it. Maybe have a figure there also. Those things should go inside this environment. This can be treated as a problem in terms of counting. See \refCom{makeset} for more info.
\end{docEnvironment}
\subsection{Configuration and options}
You can do a lot of configurations on this package, and probably
 even more to come in later versions!
\begin{docCommand}{exercisebanksetup}{\marg{[key/values]}}
 Here is a list of the different keys and their meaning
\keyDef{part problems}{On/Off}{On}{
 This is whether or not to do part problems. E.g. 1a), 1b) etc.
 If this is turned Off, then the part problems will be treated as problems
}
\keyDef{tighten paragraphs}{True/False}{True}{
 Disabling this will prevent
 the package from attempting to prevent part problems to scatter across pages
}
\keyDef{problem header}{macro}{see below}{
 This sets the problem header. To access the translation of the problem text, use \dac{@tr}\{Problem\}, and
 the problem counter is accessed with \dac{theproblemcounter}.\\
 Defaults to\\
 \brackets{\dac{normalfont}\dac{Large}\dac{bfseries}\dac{@tr}\{Problem\}~\dac{theproblemcounter}}.
}
\keyDef{part problem header}{macro}{see below}{
 This sets the problem header. To access the current problem, use \dac{theproblemcounter}, and then the current
 part problem \dac{thepartproblemcounter}. To make it a letter, as per default use \dac{alph}\{partproblemcounter\}\\
 Default is:\\
 \dac{large}\dac{textbf}\{(\dac{theproblemcounter}\dac{alph}{partproblemcounter\})}
}
\keyDef{solution header}{string}{see below}{
\dac{large}\{\dac{textbf}{\dac{@tr}{Solution\}:}}
}
\keyDef{exercise directory}{string}{./}{
This key is used for setting the default exercise directory.
}
\begin{dispListing}
 \exercisebanksetup{exercise directory=exercises,part problems=Off,solution header={\textbf{SOL:}}}
\end{dispListing}
\end{docCommand}
\subsection{Internationalization}
\begin{docCommand}{translateExBank}{\marg{Translation key/vals}}
This is to translate the text inside the package. As of now the available key/values are
\begin{itemize}
\item Problem
\item Solution
\end{itemize}
The Norwegian translation would then be done with
\begin{dispListing}
\translateExBank{Problem=Oppgave, Solution=LÃ¸sning}
\end{dispListing}
\end{docCommand}
\subsection{Triggers}
\begin{docCommand}{Trigger}{\marg{Any Macro}}
 See \refCom{At}\\
 Available triggers:\\
\dac{Trigger}\dac{BeginPartproblem}:\\ Triggers before a partproblem is inserted\\
\dac{Trigger}\dac{VeryBeginPartproblem}:\\ Triggers right after \dac{BeginPartproblem}. This is so that the user can do stuff before the actual headers start. The partproblem headers are invoked by \dac{At}\dac{VeryBeginPartproblem}
\dac{Trigger}\dac{InputExercise}:\\ Triggers before a file is included\\\
\dac{Trigger}\dac{BeginProblem}:\\ Triggers before a file is included, but only if problem headers are to be written (no [nohead] given)\\
\dac{Trigger}\dac{EndProblem}:\\ Triggers right after problem is included if [nohead] \dac{emph}\{not\} given\\
\dac{Trigger}\dac{BeginBuildset}:\\ Triggers right before a set has begun building (not if \dac{sprite} is used). You might want to put your set-header here\\
\dac{Trigger}\dac{EndBuildset}:\\ Triggers when a set has stopped building (not if \dac{sprite} is used)\\


\end{docCommand}
\subsection{General reference}
\begin{docCommand}{ownLineNoSpacesGotIt}{}
This is to annoy the user enough to get his attention about the requirements of the \refEnv{problem}, \refEnv{solution} and \refEnv{intro} environments.\\
\end{docCommand}
\begin{marker}DEPRECATED! use \refCom{exercisebanksetup} with \refKey{exercise directory} instead!\end{marker}
\begin{docCommand}{setExercisesDir}{\marg{directory}}
\begin{marker}\dac{setExercisesDir} is deprecated! use \refCom{exercisebanksetup} with \refKey{exercise directory} instead!\end{marker}
This is the directory, relative to the file you included the package,
where the package should be looking for exercises. Default is the same directory as your main file (the one you build).
\end{docCommand}
This package also includes some extra stuff. For example the \dac{At} and \dac{Trigger}
\begin{docCommand}{At}{\marg{AnyMacro}}
Here you can send any macro because it isn't evaluated! For example \dac{At}\dac{BeginSomething} is fine and even if \dac{BeginSomething} is not defined. Also and when using \dac{Trigger} it just ignores it if it didn't exist. It's pretty similar in function as to \dac{AtBeginDocument}.
\begin{dispListing}
 \At\BeginSomething{DoSomething}
 Which is triggered with
 \Trigger\BeginSomething, this evaluates to DoSomething
\end{dispListing}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{isin}{\marg{haystack}\marg{needle}\marg{True}\marg{False}}
 \meta{haystack} is a comma separated list of integers\\
 \meta{needle} is an integer\\
 Executes \meta{True} if \meta{needle} is found in \meta{haystack}
 else executes \meta{False}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{exerciseFile}{}
This is a `read-only' macro that contains the name of the current exerciseFile
\end{docCommand}
\subsection{Making sets}
\begin{docCommand}{makeset}{\oarg{intro,nohead}\marg{filable}}
 This command is the one you use to make a set! Later you use \dac{buildset} to build the sets you make. The \meta{filable} argument is either the name of the file relative to the \dac{setExercisesDir}-path (default is nothing, so it's in the root path), or you could use the \dac{select} or \dac{exclude} to  respectively cherry pick or exclude exercises. (See their docs).\\
 \oarg{intro} this counts the intro environment as a part problem, so that you can \dac{select} or \dac{exclude} the intro\\
 \oarg{nohead} prevents the builder from adding a problem header. This is handy if you want to create an exercise that is composed of multiple parts. You can use the \dac{phead} to insert the problem header where you want it
\begin{dispListing}
 \makeset[nohead]\{\phead, \select{myexercise}{1,2,3}}
\end{dispListing}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{about}{\marg{text}}
This contains information about an exercise set. It is intended to be on the top of an
exercise, explaining short what the exercise is about. It's only visible when using \dac{sprite}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{sprite}{\oarg{PiP}}
 This is a way to visualize all exercises. It takes one optional argument which is how many pages
 inside one page. Defaults to 4
 \begin{marker}If \dac{sprite} is used, it should be the only command in \dac{begin}\{document\}\dac{end}\{document\}\end{marker}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{exclude}{\marg{exerciseFileName}\marg{Comma separated numbers}}
As you can see in the intro section of the documentation, this is for excluding partproblems
To be used in \refCom{makeset}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{select}{\marg{exerciseFileName}\marg{Comma separated numbers}}
As you can see in the intro section of the documentation, this is for cherry picking partproblems
To be used in \refCom{makeset}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{exec}{\marg{macros}}
You can use this in \dac{makeset} to execute commands between problems.
E.g. to insert a new page in between two problems when using nohead:
\begin{dispListing}
\makeset[nohead]{2}{\phead,my/exercise,\exec{\clearpage},next/exercise}
\end{dispListing}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{setName}{}
This variable prints out the name of your set that you sent to \dac{buildset}.
The following example prints "Exercise set number 1" and "Exercise set number 2" on the top of each set
\begin{dispListing}
\At\StartBuildset{
 Exercise set number \setName
}
 %... \makesets here ...%
\begin{document}
 \buildset{1}{myexercise}
 \buildset{2}{myexercise}
\end{document}
\end{dispListing}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{pplabel}{\marg{label}}
Labels a partproblem. You can reference to it later using \dac{ppref}\{\meta{label\}}
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{ppref}{\marg{label}}
Reference a partproblem created by \dac{pplabel}\{\meta{label\}}. This prints e.g. 1c)
\end{docCommand}
\begin{docCommand}{ppref}{\marg{label}}
 Reference a partproblem created by \dac{pplabel}\{\meta{label\}}. This prints e.g. 1
\end{docCommand}
\subsection{Counters}
\docCounter{problemcounter}-counter holds the current problem number and
\docCounter{partproblemcounter}-counter holds the current partproblem \emph{number}.
