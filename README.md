# Updated documentation
You can download the latest documentation here: [exercisebank-doc.pdf](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/raw/master/docs/exercisebank-doc.pdf).
This is the documentation for version v0.1.0, and might not be the same as for the one on CTAN. If you're using the CTAN version (if you didn't get the package from this repo) then use the [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/exercisebank) [documentation](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/exercisebank/exercisebank-doc.pdf)

# Versions
GitHub at version: v0.1.0 (2018/04/06) build 51

CTAN at version: v0.0.6 (2018/04/03) build 47

*It might take up to 24 hours from CTAN version is uploaded until you can download it, and then even a few more days until it is updated at TeXLive and MiKTeX*

A build has no major changes in the core code (could be changes in documentation, or cosmetic changes in the code). Every time a minor version (that is the middle version number) changes, an upload is made to CTAN. If the patch version change (the last version number) is significant, it will also be uploaded to CTAN. The build number (ideally) never resets.

# Contributing
## TODO list
- [ ] Prefix internal macros with `exbank@`. E.g. switch all instances of `\isTrue` with `\exbank@isTrue`.
- [ ] Add an actual translation module, e.g. the [translations pakcage](https://ctan.org/pkg/translations) that translates automatically instead of forcing the user to use `\translateExBank`
## Files
Check out [`documentation-doc.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/documentation-doc.tex) for instructions on how to document the code. All the documentation is automatically generated from the comments in the code using a custom `perl`-script. This file shows examples on how to document the code so that it shows up in the documentation properly.
All of the code are distributed within the `src`-folder. Here is an overview. Filenames in parenthesis are not a part of the actual package, but used for "compiling" it down to `exercisebank.sty` and documenting.
### `src/`:
- (`aftercompile.sh`) is just instructions to perform after the `.sty` and the documentation is created.
- [`at.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/at.tex) contains definitions of the `\At` and `\Trigger` command
- [`envcontrol.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/envcontrol.tex) contains everything to do with controlling environments except from "outsourcing" stuff with `\At` and `\Trigger`: Namely deciding whether or not a problem, intro and/or solution should displayed (which is done in `setbuilder.tex`)
- [`i18n.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/i18n.tex) contains everything to do with translation logic.
- [`isin.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/isin.tex) contains the definition of the `\isin` macro
- [`main.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/main.tex) is the main file for building during development
- (`packagehead.tex`): All the files are compiled into one `.sty`-file before sent to [CTAN](http://ctan.org). This file contains the top of that `.sty`-file.
- [`packageoptions.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/packageoptions.tex) contains all the macros that are intended for user configuration
- [`packages.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/packages.tex) contains all the external packages used.
- [`pplabel.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/pplabel.tex)  contains definition of custom labeling and referring of problems.
- [`preamble.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/preamble.tex) contains the preamble logic. Mostly including other files.
- [`problemstyle.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/problemstyle.tex)  contains `\At`-commands that are responsible for formatting exercise headers and exercise-related styles.
- (`README.txt`) README file for CTAN.
- [`setbuilder.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/setbuilder.tex) contains the logic of the set making and set building. It also decides whether or not a problem,intro and/or solution should be built
- [`squeeze.tex`](https://github.com/Strauman/exerciseBank/blob/master/src/squeeze.tex) contains the style for which `\sprite` applies with `\squeeze`. It "squeezes" everything so that more stuff fits on the pages
- (`texpack.tex`) is the file that is built when making all these files into packaging
- (`texpackvars.ini`) contains information that is used when "compiling" the package.
### `docs/`
Docs are generated automatically. See `src/documentingExample.tex` for info on how to do documentation.
